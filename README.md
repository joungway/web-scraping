# course_project

<h3>Description</h3>
This program would first get and cache data about the key word, “fish” from the New York Times and the Guardian. Then the program will access data from these two sources with data about articles and create two lists of instances, including the article title, author, published date, word count, source, subject/section, and the most common letter in the article. Lastly, a CSV file with instances as column and data from each article as row will be created.

<br/>

<h3>The Python Modules in this file</h3>
<ul>
    <li>json</li>
    <li>csv</li>
    <li>requests</li>
</ul>

<br/>

<h3>The direction to run this file</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Open the command prompt.</li>
    <li>Suppose the file is already in the desktop, type “cd desktop” and then click Enter to go the desktop.</li>
    <li>Type “Python3 SI506F18_final_project.py” and the click Enter to open and run the file.</li>
    <li>A CSV file will be created in your desktop. That is the file that contains the data you want to find.</li>
</ol>

<br/>

<h3>The result of this project</h3>
<p>Once the program runs, in the same directory you should find a CSV file called SAMPLEarticles.csv, which should have 7 columns, containing info about the Article Title, Author, Date, Subject/Section, Words Count, Source, and Most Common Letter.</p>

<br/>

<h3>List of the primary technical requirements</h3>

    <li>Include at least 2 class definitions: 90;126</li>
    <li>Create at least 1 instance of each class: (92,93,95,96,97,99);(128,130,133,134,135,136)</li>
    <li>Invoke methods on them: 186;195</li>
    <li>Accumulate data: 200-219</li>
